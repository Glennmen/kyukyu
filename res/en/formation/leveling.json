Consider making a leveling form that’s separate from your arena form when leveling becomes difficult for you.\n• Use Hohenheim for leveling whenever possible to maximize coin earning.\n• Make heavy use of AoE (area of effect) troops to soften enemy units: Goblikazes, Ballista, Ice Mage, Priest Mage\n• Use as many Voodoo Dolls as you can. Keep them at level 4 if possible.\n• If you are really stuck at a level, use Seondeok to help you get through. If you have mostly 9-load troops, then Davison may work better. If you have neither, use Edward."
