If you have spare units, put some in the back.\n__Magic Apprentices__: fast back-line attackers who can deal AoE damage. Put them in the front so they can reach enemy's back faster.\n__Goblikazes__: self-exploding units that can weaken enemy's front line. Put them in the first and last rows.\n__Ghost Assassins__: fast-attacking units that blink to the enemy's back. Position them so they can trigger enemy's back-row Goblikazes.\n__Ballista__: powerful range units that deal damage to multiple units in a straight line. They have limited ranges, so put them in row 2-3 if possible.\n__Ice Mages__: powerful long-range units that deal damage to multiple units in a circle.\n__Archers__: fast-attacking long-range units."
