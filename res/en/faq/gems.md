Your daily gem income (level 6001~8000):

**500 gems** - For completing headhunts.
**390 gems** - For completing daily challenges.
**1200 gems** - For being active with idle chest.
**250 gems** - If you have a VIP subscription.

Full fights at the arena (all ten gem fights) will cost you **260 gems**.

Use: Gems are best used for hero shards in events (card master, wheel) and Temple of Fusion! Save temple for endgame though. It can get expensive.
