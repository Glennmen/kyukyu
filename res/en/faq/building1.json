  "description": "• A strong army often relies on high troops count. A 9-load troops (such as Undead Soldier) is often preferred over a single-load troops (such as Ogre Warriors) due to higher __combined__ health and attack power.\n• 9-load long-range troops are notoriously difficult to obtain. On average, a player needs about __17M__ coins to obtain a level 8 Archers through 240k packs, and __82M__ coins to obtain a level 8 Peltasts and a level 8 Taurus Witchers through 120k packs. New players are encouraged to focus on buying 240k packs to obtain at least 7 level-8 Archers/Taurus Witchers before switching to 120k packs."
